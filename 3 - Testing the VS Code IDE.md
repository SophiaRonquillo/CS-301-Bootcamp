# Testing the VS Code IDE

After you configure your IDE, you should test your IDE configuration by
running the provided hello world program.

# Selecting the Hello World test Program
The bootcamp repository is made up many programs and has multiple main
functions.

Click the `CMake Tool` ![img_7.png](_md_images/CMake_Tools_Icon2.png) button on the left vertical menu.

Under the `Launch` dropdown, you can select the program you wish to build.  
Click the ![img](_md_images/VSC_edit_icon.png) under the `Launch` and select 
`_Hello_World_IDE_Test_` from the list (you can also use the search bar at 
the top to more quickly find you desired target).

Do the same process to set the `Build` to `_Hello_World_IDE_Test_`.
Your `CMake Tool` menu should have `_Hello_World_IDE_Test_` selected as the 
build and launch target.

> Make sure the `Build` and `Launch` are set to the same target.

After selecting the `_Hello_World_IDE_Test_`, click the ![img_1.png](_md_images/VSC_run_btn.png)
 button at the bottom of the window to run the test.
